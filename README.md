## Task 2: Automatic Spelling Correction
The second task involves creating a program that automatically corrects spelling errors in words or given sentences. The program focuses on English language correction. The solution includes code that demonstrates the spelling correction process. Additionally, 100 data points are shown as examples, both in words and sentences.

## Task 3: Resume Filtering Application
The third task requires creating an application that assists the HR team in filtering resumes based on skills. The application uses NLP techniques to analyze resumes and extract relevant information, allowing for efficient filtering and candidate selection.

## Task 4: Hotel Management Chatbot
The fourth task involves developing a chatbot for hotel management. The chatbot is designed to assist customers in booking rooms. The chatbot collects information such as customer name, mobile number, address, ID proof, desired room type, arrival date, and departure date. The entire interaction is performed using voice-to-text classification.

Each task includes a solution that utilizes various NLP algorithms and techniques to address the specific problem. The solutions are provided in the form of code files, notebooks, or applications, depending on the task requirements.

Feel free to explore the individual task folders to access the datasets, code solutions, and any additional documentation provided.

**Note:** These solutions serve as examples for NLP tasks and provide insights into NLP techniques. It is encouraged to understand the concepts and code before applying them to other projects or datasets.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating field of natural language processing!
